Manish,OOPS 1,2024-04-14T16:53:01.768078,"This concept allows new classes to be derived from existing classes. The derived class inherits all the features of the base class, enabling code reusability and the hierarchical organization of classes. It means that he derived class can be use the fields and methods of the base class, along with its own unique attributes. This relationship is fundamental in object-oriented programming, enabling more complex behaviours to be built upon simpler ones.",INHERITANCE
Manish,OOPS 1,2024-04-14T16:53:01.768078,"This concept refers to the ability of different classes to respond the same message (or method call) in different ways. It is a core principle of object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The specific implementation that is executed depends on the objectâ€™s class. This allows for flexibility and the ability to define methods that do conceptually the same thing but operate on different types of data.",POLYMORPHISM
